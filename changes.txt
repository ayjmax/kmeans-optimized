Initial Serial Time:
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 234402μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 1μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 234400μs

------ Serial Changes ------
1. Got rid of sqrt calculation
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 226903μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 4μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 226899μs
- Slight increase in speed (?)

2. Got rid of first loop calculation when finding the getIDNearestCenter
- Somehow got slower?? In the 300,000 - 350,000μs range

3. Try putting results of calculations into a vector then sum over the vector
- The idea is that this will help the compiler optimize the loop to unravel the loop safely
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 262096μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 6μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 262090μs
- Slightly slower or about the same.

4. Turn the while(true) loop into a for loop (still w/ the break statement for the stopping condition)
- Maybe the compiler will be able to further optimize this
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 241863μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 2μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 241860μs
- Maybe even slightly slower, mostly the same speed. Averaging ~240,000-250,000 microseconds

5. Bigger Change. Add a new field to Cluster to keep track of the sum of each attribute of all points in the cluster
- I realized there's redundant looping happening, where we loop through every point essentially twice - once to re-allocate
    points to new centroids, and again to find the new centroid location based on the points in the cluster.
- If we instead have some sort of vector or array holding the sums of attribute values for all points in the cluster,
    we can reduce the overhead of looping/calculating the new centroid. We instead use this new 'attributeSums'.
- This also adds in a few more methods to Cluster class.

- Big speed up :D
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 113989μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 3μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 113986μs

6. Why does removePoint() loop through every point in the cluster?? Use a hashmap or key-value store...
- Another decent speed up :D
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 65565μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 4μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 65561μs

7. Experimental idea - what if we had a counter that kept track of how many points we've compared the cluster to, then if that
    reached some maximum/limit (total # of data points) then we perform the centroid update.
- Maybe this reduces some redundant looping?
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 12528μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 3μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 12525μs
- Doesn't work as intended (buggy) and worse performance.

8. Got rid of Change #3 and reverted back to using simple summation
- Maybe for sequential it's introducing worse performance
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 45821μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 3μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 45817μs
- Got another speedup here.

9. Return getValues() and getCentralValues() from Point and Cluster, respectively. Theory is to reduce overhead of constantly calling
    the getValueAt(idx) method.
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 45872μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 3μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 45868μs
- Does not change much, if at all.

10. Remove pow() and replace w/ simple multiplication
- There's some information online about how pow(x, 2) is slower than x*x
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 45288μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 3μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 45285μs
- Maybe a TINY difference, but almost negligible.

11. Change map<> to unordered_map<> since ordering is not necessary.
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 44130μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 3μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 44126μs
- Slight speedup, averaging ~44,000 microseconds

12. Change vectors to unique_ptr for performance and reduced heap memory overhead.
- Made it about the same time, maybe even slightly slower. Averaging ~45,500 microseconds
- I reverted this change...




------ Parallel (TBB) Changes ------
1. Parallel_for when assigning points to cluster w/ locks for modifying attributeSums and points in a cluster
- Had to change cluster vector in KMeans class to vector of unique_ptr
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 47735μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 2μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 47733μs

2. Parallel_for when clearing cluster attributeSums
- No dependency between clusters, just clearing values
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 47050μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 2μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 47047μs

3. Why do we need to add/remove points to the cluster? Since we're keeping track of attributeSums,
    we don't need info about every point in a cluster.
- Change points vector to num_points
- 
TOTAL EXECUTION TIME = 50873μs
TIME PHASE 1 = 2μs
TIME PHASE 2 = 50870μs






#?. Parallel_for when updating central values of cluster
